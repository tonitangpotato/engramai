"""
Hebbian Learning — Co-activation forms memory links

"Neurons that fire together, wire together."

When memories are recalled together repeatedly, they form Hebbian links.
These links create an associative network independent of explicit entity
tagging — purely emergent from usage patterns.

Key insight: This captures implicit relationships that the agent discovers
through experience, not explicit knowledge stored at encoding time.
