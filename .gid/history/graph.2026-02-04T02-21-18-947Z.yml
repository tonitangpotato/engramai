      Not anti-vector, anti-naive-embedding-search. Hopfield networks are theoretical support for the paper, not a
      feature to implement. Engram paired with LLM doesn't need embedding.

    layer: domain

    description: >-
      Entity extraction is done by the agent (LLM), not the library. Library provides graph storage + query APIs. No LLM
      dependency in engram-core.
  decision-no-ner:

    layer: domain
    status: active
    description: >-
      No bundled NER (unlike shodh-memory). Reasons: (1) LLM already understands semantics better than TinyBERT, (2)
      Hebbian learning provides emergent structure without NER, (3) preserves zero-dependency philosophy.

    description: >-
      engram is designed for LLM agents, not standalone. Philosophy: 'LLM is the semantic layer, engram is the dynamics
      layer'. Don't duplicate what LLM already does well.
